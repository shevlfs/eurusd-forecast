# eurusd-forecast
Euro/Dollar ratio prediction program made on Python using Tensorflow


This is my first project on Tensorflow that I made in November of 2020 and I am really proud of it, as it turned out not as bad as I thought it would. I wrote this project with the help of the original Tensorflow documentation. Originally this project was only on Google Colab and, so I thought why not upload it to Github?
